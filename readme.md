This blog is to describe my journey how I change carrer and how I manage to get in to the tech industry as a developer.

I´m not the first one that does this, but I make the decision to start sharing my journey and what will happen during the next 6 months

On July 1st 2023 I start my 185 days of coding, and I will use this blog to share my process. I´m a system engineer therefore I have a formal education in the use of multiple back and front stack and technologies as well as process, implementations etc.

During many years I work in the BPO industry where I was in a confort zone, many things happen between 2020 and 2022 that I interpretate as a sign to move to what I study and what I like. I'm afraid that I'm not good anough but I need make it happend
I lost my job in january 2023 and after 5 to 6 months of not finding a job I decide to change my mindset and do everything in my power to achieve my goals.
My fiancee quit in November 2022 as she was having health issues and the toxic work enviroment was not allowing her to recover
She push me, support me and encorage me to make this change and achieve my goal and dreams

so I am doing this not only for my but for here and to have a better future, not only beacuse development is a well pay but beacuse I really love this and love to code for hours, learn new things and be able to implement solutions to day to day and coding problems

I start my movie app using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JS. I start with the structure and the first code in CSS, I am following a tutorial in youtube, once I complete the implementation I will adjust this using bootstrap and I expect to move implement a new version using react, however this is for a future (maybe in 2 weeks or so)
